> *Be advised: the op spec is currently at Major version zero. Per the
> semantic versioning spec: "Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial
> development. Anything may change at any time. The public API should
> not be considered stable."*
>
> While Major version remains zero, a backwards compatibility guarantee
> of 2 weeks will be strictly followed to allow implementers lead time
> to implement breaking changes.
