Icon for the pkg. (since v0.1.6)

MUST be an absolute path (from pkg root) to a valid
[v1.1 SVG](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/) w/ a 1:1 aspect ratio (equal
height & width)

> SVG is a vector (as opposed to raster) graphic format; it scales infinitely large/small w/out loss of quality.

```yaml
icon: /icon.svg
