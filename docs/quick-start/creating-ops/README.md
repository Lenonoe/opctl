## Intro

In this quick start we create ops for fun and profit!

It's not required to start at the beginning or to go in order but it's
recommended if you're new to ops.

### Try as we go

Throughout the series you will likely want to try out the ops we
create

The recommended way of doing this is to use [opctl](https://opctl.io)'s
[run](https://opctl.io/docs/cli/run.html) command.

> q: does it need to be opctl?  
> a: nope. opspec is vendor agnostic; it isn't tied to opctl in any way. Opctl just happens to be "a" tool that serves our needs.
