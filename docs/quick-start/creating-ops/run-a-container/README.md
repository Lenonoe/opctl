## Introduction

In this chapter we'll create an op that starts a container, and uses the echo cmd to write
"hello world" to its std out.

## Steps

### step 1

create a dir named `run-a-container`

### step 2

add a file named `op.yml` to `run-a-container` w/ contents:
[include](op.yml)

## Conclusion

Now you have a re-useable op that starts a container, prints "hello world" inside of it, and exits. How fancy.
