## Introduction

In this chapter we'll create a pkg that uses the echo cmd to write
"hello world" to a containers std out.

## Steps

### step 1

create a dir named `hello-world`

### step 2

add a file named `op.yml` to `hello-world` w/ contents:
[include](op.yml)

## Conclusion

Now you have a re-useable package that prints "hello world" inside of a
container. How fancy.
